Predict the score of a student based on the numbers of hours spent studying. <br>
The goal of this project is to predict student scores based on the number of hours they study. By analyzing the relationship between study hours and scores, we aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate a student's performance.

The dataset used for this analysis consists of information on students' study hours and corresponding scores. It includes variables such as the number of hours studied and the achieved score. Our objective is to explore the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and develop a predictive model.

During the EDA phase, we will examine the distribution of study hours and scores, identify any outliers or missing values, and explore the correlation between these variables. We will visualize the data using various plots and charts to gain insights into the patterns and trends present.

Next, we will preprocess the data by cleaning any inconsistencies or errors, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables if necessary. Feature engineering techniques may be applied to create additional relevant features that can enhance the predictive power of the model.

After data preprocessing, we will split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train different machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines, among others. We will compare the performance of these models using appropriate evaluation metrics and select the best-performing one.

Once the model is trained and evaluated, we will apply it to the testing set to assess its predictive accuracy. We will measure its performance using metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), or R-squared value. This evaluation will help determine the model's ability to generalize to unseen data accurately.

Finally, we will interpret the results, analyze the significance of study hours on scores, and provide recommendations or insights based on the model's findings. These insights may assist educators, policymakers, or students in understanding the importance of study hours and potentially optimizing their study habits for better academic outcomes.

In summary, this project aims to develop a predictive model to estimate student scores based on the number of study hours. By leveraging EDA techniques and machine learning algorithms, we will uncover patterns and build a robust model that can provide valuable insights and predictions in the field of education.
